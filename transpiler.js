// The JavaScript ecosystem has been bubbly and foaming with new frameworks, modules, and lots more in recent years with the advent of Nodejs and NPM. Once on-the-brink-of-extinction JS evolved to become the sought-after-programming-language in the world.

// Now, In the JS world, the syntaxes have shifted a lot (still shifting), and much has been added. We have the

//     ES5
//     ES6
//     ES7
//     ES8

// All these new releases of ES* comes with new features. Old browsers will become incompatible with websites built with a newer feature or newer ES.

// If for example, Firefox v1 supports the A1 feature in ES5 when ES6 is released with the A2 feature, Firefox v1 wonâ€™t be able to support the A2 feature but a new Firefox V2 release will be built to support the A2 release so what happens to poor users still using the old Firefox v1?

// This is where transpilers come to help.
// What are Transpilers?

// Compilers translate code from one language to another ex. Java to bytecode. Transpilers translate code to the same language

// Transpilers transform the code of a language into another form of the same language. Like Java transpiler translates a form of Java code to another form of Java code.

// So a JavaScript transpiler converts a form of JS code to another form of JS. There are several transpilers that translate ES6 code to ES5:

//     Babel    
//     TypeScript
//     Traceur
